Queue - line 
First In First Out (FIFO)

        Insert   Delete
Array   O(1)      O(n)       
Singly  O(1)      O(1)    
Doubly  O(1)      O(1)
Then use Singly or Doubly.

if we copy one queue to another in the order it is removed we will get same get the same queue.
if we copy one stack to another in the order it is removed we will get the reverse of the stack.
Why didnâ€™t we use an array to implement the queue? time complexity of removing the first element is bad.
